executives are accelerating efforts to establish a unified framework for artificial intelligence (AI) regulation. The urgency stems from the rapid advancement of AI technologies, which many believe necessitate immediate international cooperation to mitigate potential risks.\n","\n","Discussions have centered on the need for ethical guidelines that ensure AI systems are developed and deployed responsibly. Concerns have been raised regarding the potential for AI to amplify societal biases, spread misinformation, and disrupt labor markets. Participants emphasized the importance of transparency in AI algorithms, advocating for mechanisms that allow for public scrutiny and accountability.\n","\n","'We are at a critical juncture,' stated a European Union delegate during a closed-door session. 'The decisions we make today will shape the trajectory of AI development for generations. It is imperative that we establish common standards that prioritize human safety and well-being.'\n","\n","The United States, while expressing support for international collaboration, has also stressed the importance of fostering innovation. 'We must strike a balance between regulation and innovation,' remarked a US official. 'Overly restrictive measures could stifle the very advancements that hold immense potential for societal benefit.'\n","\n","One of the most contentious issues remains the regulation of open-source AI models. Some argue that open-source AI should be subject to the same regulatory oversight as proprietary systems, while others contend that such measures would hinder the open exchange of knowledge and innovation.\n","\n","The formation of an international AI regulatory body has also been proposed, tasked with developing and enforcing global standards. However, the exact structure and mandate of such a body remain subjects of debate.\n","\n","As the discussions continue, the world watches closely, aware that the outcome will have profound implications for the future of AI and its role in society.\n","\"\"\"\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":7,"id":"9ff9e9a1","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.execute_input":"2025-04-21T17:54:22.426918Z","iopub.status.busy":"2025-04-21T17:54:22.426488Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-04-21T17:54:22.733193Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-04-21T17:54:22.731723Z"},"papermill":{"duration":0.312962,"end_time":"2025-04-21T17:54:22.735309","exception":false,"start_time":"2025-04-21T17:54:22.422347","status":"completed"},"tags":[]},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["Prediction: Real (51.9% confidence)\n","Key factors:\n"," - global: 0.2641\n"," - role: 0.1133\n"," - make: 0.0946\n"," - establish: -0.0929\n"," - us: -0.0775\n"]}],"source":["result = analyze_article(article)\n","print(f\"Prediction: {result['prediction']} ({result['confidence']:.1%} confidence)\")\n","print(\"Key factors:\")\n","for word, score in result['keywords']:\n","    print(f\" - {word}: {score:.4f}\")\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":8,"id":"83be886a","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.execute_input":"2025-04-21T17:54:22.744284Z","iopub.status.busy":"2025-04-21T17:54:22.743907Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-04-21T17:54:22.749056Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-04-21T17:54:22.74786Z"},"papermill":{"duration":0.011877,"end_time":"2025-04-21T17:54:22.751257","exception":false,"start_time":"2025-04-21T17:54:22.73938","status":"completed"},"tags":[]},"outputs":[],"source":["article ='''Trump Declares Himself \"King of Florida\" in Surprise Beachside Coronation\n","\n","April 21, 2025 — Mar-a-Lago, Florida\n","\n","In an unexpected move early Monday morning, former President Donald J.
